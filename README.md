Assignment 1 of Bethel University Fall 2019's Web Programming class

Basic HTML page that contains CSS and Javascript (nothing fancy-looking).

Page contains a big block of text (in my case, part of the Joker's script
from the movie The Dark Knight).
The web page has some background color and font of a different color.
The page has at least 3 different div tags, all of different colors.
  The first is positioned so that it doesn't move when the page scrolls.
  The second should be positioned on top of the text from the first.
  The last has a picture inside it.

Somewhere in the big block of text is a link to the movie clip of one of the
quotes from the text. There is also a button in the lower left corner that
changes the colors each time it is clicked.
