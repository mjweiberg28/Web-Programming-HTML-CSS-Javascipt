        "Wanna know how I got these scars? My father was…a drinker. And a fiend. And one night he goes off crazier than usual.
        Mommy gets the kitchen knife to defend herself. He doesn’t like that. Not one bit. So—me watching—he takes the knife to
        her, laughing while he does it! Turns to me, and he says, “Why so serious, son?” Comes at me with the knife...
        “Why so serious?” He sticks the blade in my mouth…“Let’s put a smile on that face!”"

        "Oh, you. You just couldn’t let me go, could you? This is what happens when an unstoppable force meets an immovable object.
        You are truly incorruptible, aren’t you? Huh? You won’t kill me out of some misplaced sense of self-righteousness. And I won’t

        "Come here. Hey! Look at me. So I had a wife, beautiful, like you, who tells me I worry too much. Who tells me I ought to smile
        more. Who gambles and gets in deep with the sharks…look at me! One day, they carve her face. And we have no money for surgeries.
        She can’t take it. I just want to see her smile again, hmm? I just want her to know that I don’t care about the scars. So… I
        stick a razor in my mouth and do this…to myself. And you know what? She can’t stand the sight of me! She leaves. Now I see the
        funny side. Now I’m always smiling!"

        "Do you want to know why I use a knife? Guns are too quick. You can’t savor all the… little emotions...you see, in their last
        moments, people show you who they really are. So in a way, I know your friends better than you ever did. Would you like to know
        which of them were cowards?"

        "It's not about money...it’s about sending a message. Everything burns!"
